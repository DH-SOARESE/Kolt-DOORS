### How to Include the License
1. **Add to the Code File**: You can place the license text at the top of your Lua script, above the `--// ðŸ“¦ Library Kolt V1.2--` header, or in a separate `LICENSE` file in the same directory as your code.
2. **Example in Code**:
   ```lua
   --[[

3. **Separate LICENSE File**: Alternatively, create a `LICENSE` file in your project directory with the above license text. This is standard practice for open-source projects.

### Notes
- **Why MIT?**: The MIT License is simple, widely recognized, and allows broad use of your library while ensuring you get credit. Itâ€™s suitable for a Roblox Lua-based ESP library like Kolt V1.2.
- **Customization**: If you want to restrict certain uses (e.g., commercial use) or require derivative works to be open-sourced, consider licenses like GPL or a custom license.
- **Roblox Context**: Since this appears to be a Roblox-related library, ensure compliance with Robloxâ€™s Terms of Service when distributing or using this library in Roblox games.
- **Language**: I provided the license in English, as itâ€™s standard for open-source licenses. If you prefer it in Portuguese (e.g., to match your code comments), I can translate it.

If you have specific requirements (e.g., a different license type, additional terms, or a Portuguese version), let me know, and Iâ€™ll adjust it!
